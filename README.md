# random-led-lightshow

A fun little project I made to teach underclassmen about [C++](https://isocpp.org/) and [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)

## General info
It's quite simple. The program will pick a random number between 1-4 and when a number is picked, a sequence of lights will play. Each number has it's own pattern.
	
## Technologies
[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)
	
## Setup
You can run this project one of two ways (to my knowledge)

Oh, here is the model I made if you want to copy what I did.

### Option One (Arduino)
1. Make your circuit (refer to my image if you wish)
2. Before you send the code to your arduino, please adjust the pin variables accordingly. It will crash if you don't!
3. Send the code to your arduino and enjoy the lightshow!

### Option Two (TinkerCAD)
1. Make an account [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/join) (of course, this assumes you don't have one)
2. Click on the **Circuits** Tab
3. Click **Create new Circuit**
4. Make your circuit (refer to my image if you wish)
5. Click the code tab
6. Click the box that has block code and change it to **Text**
7. Paste the code
8. Before you send the code to your arduino, please adjust the pin variables accordingly. It will crash if you don't!
9. Click the green **Start Simulation** button and enjoy the lightshow!
